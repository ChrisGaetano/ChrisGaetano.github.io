#### My name is Chris Gaetano and I am a junior economics major at Lehigh University. I also have a double minor in marketing  and journalism. This is my Github page for my J24 class. Over the semester I plan on working on several data visualization projects to add to my project.

This infographic displays the top 5 highest grossing films of 2016. This is the total gross for movies worldwide. The highest grossing film of the year was Captain America: Civil War.Four out of the five highest grossing films earned more than one billion worldwide. All the films were distributed by the Disney Company. This infographic was created using the website Canva.

This timeline was created using TimelineJS. The timeline goes over the all the studio albums that the Beatles have produced. The timeline discusses the year the albums came out and it discusses some of the songs on the albums. The timeline starts with the Beatles' first albums Please Please Me, and it ends with Let It Be. 


## Netflix Subscriber Growth

![Netflix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisGaetano/ChrisGaetano.github.io/master/Worldwide_Netflix_Subscribers_Number_of_Subscribers_(In_Millions)_chartbuilder.png)

This chart displays how Netlfix subscribers have grown overtime. As you can see steady growth from 2007 to 2017. With Netflix being the most popular it has been in years it makes sense that the graph is at its peak point in 2017. 2011 is the year in which Netflix became international, so you can see that in this year the growth becomes quicker. This timeline was created using information from Netflix annual reports and the graphic was created using Chartbuilder 3.0.5.


## Lehigh Valley Movie Theaters

This is a map that displays various movie theaters in the Lehigh Valley area. I chose these movie theaters because they are all theaters that are close to Lehigh University, and they are all pretty diverse theaters. The map shows movie theaters ranging from brand new cineplexes with popular new movies, to historical movie theaters, to movie theaters showcasing documentaries and films of the arts. This map was created using the Google Fusion program.

 This bar chart compares several films that hit theaters in between the years of 2007 and 2011. The graph does not contain every movie that came out between these years, but it contains some of teh most notable films from this time period. This graph allows you to compare the films based off of genre, studio that produced the films, rotten tomatoes score, year and worldwide gross. This information was gathered using a dataset from tableau public. The data visualization was created using the Tableau Software.

  These graphs display two of the most profitable movie franchises in the modern movie franchise. The Marvel and DC movies are some of the higheset grossing films, and now we can compare the two to see how much they are actually making relevent to domestic and worldwide gross. We can also see how much the two franchises spent on production costs. Another way we can compare the two industries is through critic and user scores, which will show you how a critic likes the movie versus that of a regular movie goer. The information was gathered using statistics from Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo, and the visualization was created with Tableau Software.
